Coskun is a Ph.D. Candidate of Mathematics Education and Master's student in Statistics at Iowa State University. He collaborates with Dr. Ji-Yeong in the NSF-funded IM2EB project that aims to build teacher capacity for implementing mathematical modeling lessons by involving teachers in co-planning and co-teaching with researchers who are experts in Emergent Bilingual mathematics instruction. Coskun was a member of the 2020-2021 cohort of the CADRE-fellows program. He is currently investigating the role of parental involvement and institutional agent support in students' mathematics course taking in high school for his dissertation, with a focus on immigrant students.
